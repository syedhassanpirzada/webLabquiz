        <h3>Oral Maxillofacial Surgery / Orthodontics</h3>
        <p>
            Dentistry also referred to as Dental and Oral Medicine deals with the diagnosis, prevention as well as treatment of various conditions of the oral cavity. This includes diseases and disorders of the teeth and their supporting, nearby structures or tissues such as the head, tongue, salivary glands, and particularly the maxillofacial region. Although primarily associated with diseases of the teeth and gums, specialty branches such as Cosmetic Dentistry can also help improve dental aesthetics, i.e., proper positioning, shape, sizing, color, and alignment of teeth, as well as other oral features.Usually, a general practice dentist serves as the primary dental health care provider, providing regular checkups and treatments to ensure the optimal oral and dental health of patients. They also perform root canals, fillings, veneers, bridges, crowing and educate patients on teeth/gum care and dietary choices that can impact their oral health. These types of dentists typically work with a collaborative dental team comprising dental assistants/associates, hygienists, therapists, and technicians.</p>
